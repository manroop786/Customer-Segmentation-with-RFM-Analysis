# Customer-Segmentation-with-RFM-Analysis
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis for effective customer segmentation. RFM is a powerful method used in marketing and e-commerce to categorize customers based on their transaction behaviors. The acronym stands for:

Recency (R): How recently a customer has made a purchase.
Frequency (F): How often a customer makes a purchase.
Monetary (M): The monetary value of a customer's purchases.
The primary goal of this project is to showcase the implementation of RFM Analysis to understand and categorize customers into segments, enabling businesses to tailor marketing strategies and optimize their engagement with different customer groups.
